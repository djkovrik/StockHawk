Stock Hawk App created as a part of Udacity [Android Developer Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-developer-nanodegree-by-google--nd801). The application allows user to track stocks data using Yahoo finance API.

## Udacity Instructions

This is the starter code for project 3 in Udacity Android Developer Nanodegree Program.

The app currently finds stock prices from the internet and allows users to add stocks to track.

Your job will be to take the user feedback in the UX Review and implement changes that will make the app production ready.

All of the issues you need to address to meet specifications are hinted at in the UX Review. There are also a few optional ways in which the apps can be improved that are not mentioned in the UX Review.

## Users feedback

- [x] *"Right now I can't use this app with my screen reader. My friends love it, so I would love to download it, but the buttons don't tell my screen reader what they do."*
- [x] *"We need to prepare Stock Hawk for the Egypt release. Make sure our translators know what to change and make sure the Arabic script will format nicely."*
- [X] *"Stock Hawk allows me to track the current price of stocks, but to track their prices over time, I need to use an external program. It would be wonderful if you could show more detail on a stock, including its price over time."*
- [x] *"I use a lot of widgets on my Android device, and I would love to have a widget that displays my stock quotes on my home screen."*
- [x] *"I found a bug in your app. Right now when I search for a stock quote that doesn't exist, the app crashes."*
- [X] *"When I opened this app for the first time without a network connection, it was a confusing blank screen. I would love a message that tells me why the screen is blank or whether my stock quotes are out of date."*
